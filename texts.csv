"I've been meaning to write for ages and finally today I'm actually doing something about it. Not that I'm trying to make excuses for myself, it's been really hard to sit down and write, as I've been moving around so much. Since we last saw each other I've unpacked my bags in four different cities. This job has turned out to be more of a whirlwind than I expected, but it's all good! I went from London to Prague to set up a new regional office there. You know I'd always wanted to go, but maybe I was imagining Prague in spring when I used to talk about that. Winter was really hard, with minus 15 degrees in the mornings and dark really early in the evening. But at least it was blue skies and white snow and not days on end of grey skies and rain, like at home. It's tough being away from home over Christmas, though, and Skype on Christmas Day wasn't really the same as being with everyone. From there I was on another three-month mission to oversee the set-up of the office in New York. Loved, loved, loved New York! It's like being in one big TV show, as everywhere looks just a little bit familiar. I did every tourist thing you can think of when I wasn't working, and must have spent most of my salary on eating out. It was really hard to leave for the next job, especially as I kind of met someone (!) More about Michael later ... So then I was posted to LA, which felt like a whole other country compared with the East Coast. I could definitely get used to that kind of outdoor, beach lifestyle, but I didn't spend as much time getting to know California as I could have because I was flying back to see Michael every other weekend. He came to see me when he could, but his job means he's often working at weekends, so he couldn't make the flight very often. Those three months flew by and then I was off again, to Frankfurt, which is where I am now. And … so is Michael! He got a month off work and we're trying to work out how we can be in the same place at the same time for a while. We figure the first step in that direction is getting married, which is also why I wanted to write – I can't get married without my oldest friend there! The wedding's going to be at home in London in September and I hope you can come! Anyway, tell me all your news and I promise not to leave it so long this time! Lots of love, Kath"
"I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. Second, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!"
"Hi Meena, Thank you so much for offering to house sit for us next week. I'm only sorry we won't get to catch up properly until we get back from our trip. Anyway, here's everything I won't have time to tell you on Saturday morning. The alarm code is 7957. Don't forget to set it when you go out and remember to turn it off when you get back home as it is LOUD! The rabbits need feeding once a day and under no circumstances should they be allowed out of their cage in the garden as the neighbour's cats have attacked them in the past. Please can you use the washing machine in the daytime only as it's old and noisy and the neighbours complain otherwise? Would you mind opening all the upstairs windows for an hour in the morning as the house gets damp at this time of year? That's about it! You'll find everything you need in the house, and help yourself to anything in the fridge or cupboards. Feel free to call or text if you have any problems/questions. See you briefly to hand over keys on Saturday morning and looking forward to a proper chat when we get back! Thanks again! Suki"
"Hi Helga,
I've been meaning to write to you for ages now so don't worry! How did your exams go? When will you know your results? I'm sure you did brilliantly as always!
As for me, I'll have been in the new job three months by the end of next week so I'm feeling more settled in. At first I felt like I had no idea what I was doing but now I realise it's normal to feel like that. There was a lot to learn – there still is actually – and I soon had to get used to the idea that I can't know everything. I used to work late a lot and at weekends but I'm slowly getting into a normal routine.
Which means I'd love to come and visit! We really need a good catch up! I can't believe we haven't seen each other since Carl's wedding. How does next month sound?
Anyway, I'd better get back to work.
Congratulations on the new flat! Can't wait to see you!
Love,
Linda"
"Dear Professor Henley,
I am writing to inform you that, unfortunately, I am unable to continue to attend the Logic II course this semester. I would like to request permission to defer as I understand that this is only possible with your approval.
The issue is that I am currently doing an internship with ABC Ltd. It started in July and will continue until the end of the semester. The internship takes up 25 hours per week and I am concerned that it does not leave me with enough time to study. I have already asked if I can reduce my hours there, but this is not possible.
With your approval, I could take Logic II next semester instead. I realise that this would mean a heavier workload than usual next semester, but I assure you that I would be able to manage my time and keep up.
Thank you for considering my request and I would be happy to come in and discuss the matter further.
Regards,
Sarah Price"
"Hello, Semyon! I'm here to listen and keep you company."
"I'm glad to hear that you're feeling happy today! It's always nice to have a positive attitude. As for me, things have been going well lately. I just do my job and enjoy my vacation when I can. Do you have any interesting plans or projects?"
"Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun! Sheregesh is a beautiful place, I'm sure you had a great time with your friends. Have you been skiing or snowboarding? I've always wanted to try myself in these types of activities. It's nice to relax and spend time with friends, especially at such a busy time as now. How was the trip overall? Have you had any memorable experiences?"
"It's nice to hear your opinion again. I missed you too! I'm always here to chat and keep you company. Is there anything specific that you would like to talk about, or any game that you would like to play?"
"My name is Anna, I am a third-year student of the Faculty of Psychology. In my free time, I love reading books and cycling in the park. I recently started learning Spanish, and I really like it. I also volunteer at a local animal shelter where I take care of cats and dogs. My dream is to become a professional psychologist and help people cope with their problems."
"I've always loved creating beautiful spaces and making people happy in their homes. On weekends, I often go to the cottage, where I grow my favorite flowers. I really love cooking and often experiment with new recipes in the kitchen. In the future, I plan to open my own design bureau."
"I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak. It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids. The new range looks amazing. The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice. The tee boxes look state of the art and the clubhouse looks like something you'll see on a newer course. Can't wait to experience it!"
"I always love a good dinner. Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning. Good food. Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. This place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem. I had french toast and bacon. The french toast was made with the best Italian bread. My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill. It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and homemade sausage. Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it! They also had great coffee. They actually ground up the beans in front of us. Now that's fresh. We want to return sometime for turkey day.  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday. Now that sounds good! Can't wait to return."
"I bought a three month membership last year, mainly to attend the Silver Sneakers classes. I was in my early sixties and hadn't exercised in a while. I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn't feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. Do they think that this is their private gym?"
"I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. "
"Dear Steve,
Since you requested in our recent line management meeting for me to inform you of any issues, I'm writing to tell you about a recent incident. Last week, after experiencing some difficulties with the order processing system, tensions arose in the team and a confrontation occurred between two team members.
I've outlined what led to this incident below:
1. There was a system update that we weren't expecting last week. The update slightly changed the interface menu. Everything is still there but people have said it's not easy to find some of the menu items they're looking for.
2. There seems to have been a period of time after the update that new entries weren't being saved. This led to some work being lost. We worked overtime to catch up on everything and all orders have been processed. But as a consequence there was a general feeling of pressure and tiredness in the team.
As a result of these challenging circumstances there was some tension, leading to a disagreement between Johann and Maria. Johann lost his temper and made some inappropriate remarks to Maria.
I met with them both in order to reflect on and resolve the conflict. Johann has apologised for his behaviour and he realises that Maria could have chosen to start disciplinary proceedings. They have worked together on a plan to improve communication and therefore alleviate tensions within the team.
I've also asked our colleagues in the IT department to run a training session for us all on how to best use the system in light of the recent software upgrades.
There's no specific action for you to take, but I felt it important that you're kept in the loop.
I'll keep you posted.
Regards,
Sara"
"To: Sunny Chen
Hi Sunny!
How are you?
We're finally coming to Singapore so I wanted to ask your advice on what we should do while we're there. What shouldn't we miss? We'll have our two kids aged 6 and 8 with us so ideally we want to do things we can enjoy as a family.
We've already got a hotel booked in Marina Bay and we arrive on 12 May for a week.
I hope you're around so we can meet up!
See you soon,
Janet"
"To: Janet Hill
Hi Janet!
Lovely to hear from you and how exciting that you're coming!
You've picked a great area to stay in as it's right next to a must-see attraction, Gardens by the Bay. They light them up at night and the kids will love it. Another place to take the little ones is the zoo, and the Night Safari is really worth doing. The animals are much more active at night than during the day, so it's pretty special.
As for food, there's quite a variety here. I'd recommend trying laksa and kaya toast вЂ“ they're both really typical Singaporean foods. You can also eat well and cheaply at street markets. You should definitely check them out.
Can't wait to see you all!"

Subject: Request for new price list for V1698 face creams
Dear Yuki,  
We are presenting to some new clients next Monday 10 December and they are interested in our V1698 face creams.
I understand from Kate that the prices have changed recently. She mentioned that you have the new price list. Do you think you could email it to me?
I would be grateful if we could have it by close of business on Thursday 6 December. That would give us time to prepare for our presentation.
Thanks very much for your help.
Best regards,

"She offered her car to her brother. He said he would think about it. ""Let me think about it,"" he said. She called him up a week later. ""Do you want my car for free?"" she asked. He said, ""I'm thinking about it."" She asked, ""How long do you have to think about it?"" He said he didn't know. ""Let me think about it some more,"" he said. She called up a charity. She said, ""Do you want my car for free?"" The man at the charity said yes. She asked, ""You don't have to think about it?"" He said, ""No, I don't have to think about it. Who has to think about a free car?"" He picked up her car the next day."
"She was a fast eater. She liked to eat fast. She ate like a wolf. ""I am like a wolf,"" she said. He was a slow eater. He liked to eat slow. He ate like a turtle. ""You are like a turtle,"" she said. She didn't talk at the dinner table. All she did was eat. He liked to talk at the dinner table. He talked about the news. He talked about the weather. He talked about sports. She listened to him talk. She nodded her head. That meant yes. She shook her head. That meant no. He talked. She listened. She never said yes. She never said no. She never said anything. All she did was eat."
"He called up the post office. ""Where is my package?"" he asked. ""What is the tracking number?"" the postal worker asked. He told her the tracking number. She said, ""Your package is at the main post office. You can pick it up anytime."" He said, ""I don't want to pick it up. Can you deliver it?"" She said yes. ""We will deliver it on Monday,"" she said. ""Will you be home?"" He said, ""What time on Monday?"" She said, ""Anytime between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m."" He said, ""I have to work. I can't stay home all day."" She said, ""That's okay. We can deliver it on Tuesday."" He said, 'I have to work on Tuesday, too. Please deliver it on Saturday.'"
"I am not a very sporty person. There arenвЂ™t too many sports that I like doing. I have tried playing
tennis in a club but I was so bad at it that nobody wanted to play with me. So I gave it up. Ball games
are not my world. There is one activity, however, which I really enjoy, and that is cycling. Every day
when I get home from work I take my bike from the garage and off I go. I usually cycle for about an
hour except when it rains. I avoid the busy streets of my town and I especially enjoy cycling along
forest paths. As for my diet, I am not a very healthy eater and I must admit that I eat a very big
dinner every evening."
"I have always enjoyed keeping active from a very young age. I participated in different sporting
events at school such as volleyball, basketball and athletics events. At university I won several
running races as a member of the athletics club, so running has become my favourite activity.
Today I not only go jogging regularly but I started training for the marathon. I get some help from
a professional trainer because I need a training schedule that I can follow. This takes up a lot of my
time so I donвЂ™t go out much. Also I have to watch my diet if I want to be successful at the marathon.
Some people may think that this is very tiring but I enjoy every minute of it. In fact I enjoy all sorts
of exercise but I am not a fan of swimming."
"Soon after I first came to visit China in the autumn of 1971, I saw a contingent of militia soldiers doing marching drills in Tiananmen Square. I was told they were rehearsing for the annual National Day parade on October 1, which people eagerly awaited."
"He is in that landing pattern that middle-aged heartthrobs finally come to: time for home and family and a woman who is worthy of keeping his love.
The 50-plus Oscar winner, producer and political activist George Clooney is apparently engaged to be married. He's at a particularly pivotal age. Forget about the 50s being the new 40s -- the 50s are really very specific. Even the most youthful people will start thinking about the meaning of life as the years no longer stretch out in a fantasy of infinity. Those years between 50 and 60 do seem to be a particularly poignant age for men, especially the kind of man who has trouble giving up motorcycles.
Sometime in this period, the thrill seekers and lust lovers get their whiff of mortality -LRB- perhaps because of their latest motorcycle accident -RRB- and they turn to love with a new sense of its gravitas. With a nod to the motivation most of us mortals have, they are ready for an emotional legacy. -LRB- Hint: watch for children -RRB-
It might irk Clooney to be seen as so predictable. He's a gifted, idiosyncratic, goes-his-own-way, irreverent kind of guy."
"I just returned from the greatest summer vacation! It was so fantastic, I never wanted it to end. I spent eight days in Paris, France. My best friends, Henry and Steve, went with me. We had a beautiful hotel room in the Latin Quarter, and it wasnвЂ™t even expensive. We had a balcony with a wonderful view.
We visited many famous tourist places. My favorite was the Louvre, a well-known museum. I was always interested in art, so that was a special treat for me."

Subject: Report on Lumos conference
Dear Jonas,
Thanks for making it possible for me to go to the Lumos conference in London last week. As you know, it is the biggest technology conference in the country and very important to our work.
I learned a lot and I've made some new contacts that will be good for our company. I think we should try to attend the 'Innovation Day' in April as well.
I focused on talks about robotics, as that is our most interesting area at the moment. The presentations on robot 'hands' and robots for hospitals were particularly interesting for us. I'm attaching a detailed report on this new research with some suggestions about how we can use it.
Thanks again for this opportunity. I'm happy to discuss the report further if you're interested.
Best regards,
Nina"
"I had the most wonderful childhood. I grew up in San Diego, where it rains about two days a year, and it's always sunny and bright. I could ride my bike just about any day of the year, and had lots of friends. My best friend was George Kenny. George lived just a few houses down the block from me and we were the same age. Actually, I was about 28 days older than him вЂ“ a fact that I always threw in his face. ""You must respect your elders,"" I would sometimes tell him. That usually got a nasty response from him. Anyway, George came up to me one day and said, 'Hey Richard, why don't we form a bicycle club?'"
